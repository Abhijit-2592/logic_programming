# Lectures
Here the  lectures are transcribed mostly as prolog files since the professor gives a lot of code examples in class.
The lecture notes are present as comments in the file. The prolog files may nor run and will have linter errors because, a few functions are not defined etc. Use it as a transribe of the class and for future reference.
